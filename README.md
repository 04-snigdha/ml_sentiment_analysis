# Sentiment Analysis using Classical Machine Learning Models

This repository contains the source code, datasets, and results for a sentiment analysis project that compares the performance of four classical machine learning models: **k-Nearest Neighbours (kNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF),** and **Logistic Regression (LR)**.
## ðŸ“Š Project Overview

The project explores how different machine learning models perform on a **multiclass sentiment classification** task. The dataset consists of seven emotional categories: `angry`, `sad`, `happy`, `shame`, `disgust`, `surprise`, and `fear`.

All models were evaluated using:
- 7-fold cross-validation
- Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score
- Confusion matrices for class-wise insights
- One-way ANOVA and Tukey's HSD for statistical significance testing
